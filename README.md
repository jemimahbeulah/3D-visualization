# Using the patient's CT scan, I created a 3D visualization model of the vertebral column. I used the Python programming language to analyze the supplied data set (.dcm files) and identified three dimensions: axial, sagittal, and coronal. Furthermore, using the 3D Slicer software, I have segmented the given Dicom files and produced a three-dimensional representation of the vertebral column from the patient's CT scan.
